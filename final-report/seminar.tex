If the same is reversed where IBM uses Facebook way of development it might not do as well as IBM has way more employees than Facebook and managing and tracking would become a difficult task. Also, most of the Facebook's apps run on their servers, hence they provide services. Whereas IBM does both they provide services by running software on their machines and they also provide software to be run and used by the buyer. Hence rolling out would not be possible every now and then. Also, rigorous testing is required as rolling back or updating a software running on someone else's machine is difficult and inconvenient. So, for making sure that their rollout is stable their software has to take an agile process of development.
