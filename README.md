In UCD, the college where I did my Bachelor's. We had a Module where we had 6 Labs on various topics on Clean Code. 

We also had 3 seminars given by `IBM`, `Facebook` and `FoodCloud`. In the seminars they discussed about their software development processes and practices they followed. They also shared their experiences and ideas on various topics on clean code, software maintainability etc.

### Side Notes

I have written the report in LaTeX. Which is very handy and easy for creating beautiful reports. The best part about using LaTex is that it is easy to maintain as everything is in simple text.
